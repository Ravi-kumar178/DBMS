Relational Model -> It is a data model that describes the data in the form of relations/tables.
In relational db, there is a multiple relations and where each relation has unique name.
Tuple -> a single row of table .
Column -> column represents the attributes of table.
Relation Schema -> Relation Schema describes the name of relation, attribute/column name.
Degree of table -> No. of column of a relation defines the degree of table.
cardinality -> Total number of tuple of a given relation.

Important properties of table ->
a) Each table of a db has unique name.
b) Each attribute of the table should be unique
c) The value of the attribute has to be atomic.
d) Table must follow the integrity constraints.

Relational Model Key ->
1)Super Key -> It is all the P&C of attribute of a relation so that each row can be identified uniquly
2)Candidate Key -> It is the minimum subset of super key so that each tuple of a relation can be identified uniquly.
3)Primary Key -> It is the minimum number of attribute that should be selected in order to uniquly identify each tuple. The Primary key is extracted from the candidate key.
4)Foreign Key -> It is used to establish association among two relation. In most case the PK is used as a Fk . so the relation whose Primary key is used Refrenced(parent) relation and the other is called as Refrencing relation.

Integrity Constraints ->
The CRUD operation on DB must be done with some integrity policy so that the DB is always consistent.

Domain Constraints -> 
It restricts the value of the attribute by defining the domain of the attributes.
It restricts the data type of the attributes by speicifying the data type of attribute

Entity Constraints -> Every relation should have PK, i.e. PK != NULL.

Refrential Constraints -> 
It is specified between two relations and help to maintain consistancy among two tuples of two relations.
On Insert Constraints -> You can't insert tuple into child relation if the data is not present into the parent relation.
On Delete Constraints -> You can't delete the tuple of the parent relation if there is data present in the child relation.

Key Constraints ->
a)unique
b)Not Null
c)default
d)Check
e)Primary Key
f)Foreign Key
